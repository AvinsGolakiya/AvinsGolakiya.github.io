              <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-left">FlickPix will be an app that helps a group of people collectively decide on a movie to watch. A group of people will be able to choose broad aspects about movies that they would like to watch such as genre or streaming service availability. Based on the chosen aspects, it will then begin to give random suggestions that fit them and then allow each person to judge the suggestions. After each person has individually made their judgments, FlickPix will then take them into account before giving a final recommendation that it deems the most likely to be enjoyed by everyone.
                <br>
                <br> There will also be ways for people to keep track of statistics related to the movies they’ve watched. These statistics will then open up new options to influence their movie suggestions. If aspects such as the director or the cast of a previously watched movie are appealing, then people can easily find these using their tracked statistics and apply them to their suggestions. The app will also have a feature that allows friends to create groups where they can discuss and plan movie nights together.
                <br><br> The main audience for the app will be groups of friends that enjoy watching movies together. Since people can have different preferences when it comes to movies, FlickPix aims to find common ground between members of a group and recommend movies that all participants will enjoy. However, it will still be usable for avid movie watchers who enjoy watching movies alone since they can still get movie recommendations based on their preferences without having to factor in other people’s preferences.
                <br><br> With a plethora of streaming services with vast libraries of movies being available, people can be overcome with the large amount of possible choices for movies to watch. Our vision is to revolutionize the way friends experience movies together. FlickPix seamlessly blends the excitement of film discovery and the fun of social interaction, allowing users to easily find movies tailored to their individual preferences and tastes. Having the app give quick suggestions rather than manually combing through movie catalogues will also help speed up the time it takes to decide on a movie. Comparing choices between members of a group and finding what fits best for the whole group will also help reduce the amount of disputes that could arise from preferential differences between the members. The random nature of the suggestions also has the possibility of showing movies that someone may have never heard of. This can lead to people being exposed to movies they never would have given a chance otherwise.
